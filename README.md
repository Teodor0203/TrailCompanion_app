# TrailCompanion app - Android app for IoT project
## Description

**TrailCompanion** is an app designed to track your bike rides. It connects to a device that measures various parameters, such as braking intensity, acceleration, top speed, distance, average speed, and current location. Based on the data received from the device, the app maps the route following the user's location and colors it according to braking intensity. Users can save their rides and view them later in the "**Trails**" menu, where they can check the total distance, top speed, and average speed.
